## QSU2: A QGIS Processing Plugin to Prepare the SU2 Files for CFD Simulations

QSU2 is an open-source QGIS processing plugin developed by the KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence, University of Cyprus which operates within the QGIS environment, for providing an interface for the [SU2 software](https://su2code.github.io/),  an open-source software suite for simulation and optimization in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), developed at Stanford University. This tool is particularly useful for engineers, researchers, and professionals engaged in CFD analysis, enabling them to efficiently prepare their simulation environments using geospatial data.
